import these into studies.  

These only work in time charts. 


The way I have it is..

##shows PREM aka difference between SPX Cash and S&P futures 
##note. When the spread or Difference between cash and futures
##gets too wide, buy/sell programs get initiated to bring them back into par.

Set Chart with the ticker  "/es-spx"

##timeframe setting must be in Mins, tick charts will not work

5day - 1min(fastest) / extended session off

##import studies by clicking Studies > Edit Studies > Import Studies
UVOL_DVOLSTUDY.ts  < Uvol dvol
ADVDECLSTUDY.ts   <  Advancers vs decliners
TIKI_RULERSTUDY.ts   <  Nyse $TICK

##For volatility or VIX 
Add Study "Comparison (VIX)" / Set to line or bar

Let me know what you think.
